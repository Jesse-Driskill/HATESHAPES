Background:

  Hate Shapes is a customizable shoot 'em up experience, similar to duck hunt. The player is tasked with destroying as many objects as possible.
  Failing to shoot a certain amount of shapes will result in the player losing the game. For now there are planned to be 10 levels and upon completing     the tenth level the player will win.

Functionality:

* The player can customize the music that plays during the game
* The player can adjust the volume of and mute the game's audio
